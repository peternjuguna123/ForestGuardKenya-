# ForestGuardKenya:-
ForestGuardKenya is a proof-of-concept nanosatellite project designed to aid in forest conservation by monitoring deforestation, illegal logging, charcoal burning, and forest fires. The system integrates space-based and terrestrial technologies to provide real-time forest intelligence.

**Key Features**:
- Nanosatellite in LEO for capturing optical and infrared images of forest zones.
- Ground sensor network to detect gas emissions (CO/COâ‚‚), sounds (chainsaws), and environmental changes.
- Integrated communication between ground sensors, the satellite, and a ground station.
- Data visualization & alerts from the ground station for quick response.
- Machine learning potential for long-term predictive analysis.

**Goal**:
To provide a cost-effective, scalable solution that complements reforestation efforts by ensuring planted trees are protected and illegal activities are detected early.
